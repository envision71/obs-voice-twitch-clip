# obs-voice-twitch-clip

## Set Up
First the plugin needs permission to clip on your behalf. To give the plugin permission click the link in the description of the plugin. Then paste the redirect URL in the first box in the plugin settings. Then enter your twitch user name in the second options box. Select the source the plugin to listen to and the decibel level for a clip creation to be triggered at.

## Usage
Please wait 5-10 for the plugin to detect that the stream has started. Once it detects the stream is live it will clip when volume reaches the threshold and output the clip link to a file called Clip_URLS.csv located in the same folder as the plugin file.
